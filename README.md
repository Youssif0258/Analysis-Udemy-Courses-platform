This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization on a dataset of Udemy courses. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to uncover insights such as the distribution of courses by subject, price, and level, as well as relationships between course attributes like price, number of subscribers, and reviews. The project also visualizes trends and patterns using various plots, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
